Custom Discord Bot for a friend's chat channel

Currently the Discord Bot has the following commands:

!fyc [name]
-Responds with a message that says: "Hey [name]" and posts a picture from the Dave Chapelle Rick James skit. This is a place holder for using embedded messages.

!hello_world
-Responds with "Hello World!"
